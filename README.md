# Messaging-Platform
This project is a practical assignment for the Operating Systems course, focusing on the development of a topic-based messaging platform using the C language on a UNIX/Linux system.  The main objective is to demonstrate a solid understanding of UNIX system mechanisms such as processes, pipes, signals, and file descriptors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Execution

To build the platform files and clean previously generated ones, you can use the following commands:

1. **Clean previously generated files**  
   ```bash
   make clean

2. **Generate the files again**  
   ```bash
   make
